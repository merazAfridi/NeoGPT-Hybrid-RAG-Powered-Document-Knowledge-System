# NeoGPT-Local-Document-Knowledge-Graph-and-Query-System


NeoGPT is an integrated system that combines knowledge graph generation with AI-powered querying, creating a seamless workflow for document analysis and question answering. The system operates in two main stages:

# Knowledge Graph Creation:
User-uploaded documents are processed using advanced LLMs to extract key entities, relationships, and insights. These are stored in Neo4j as structured graphs, enabling efficient and interactive querying.

# AI-Powered Query System:  
Leveraging Ollama's local AI models, NeoGPT interprets user queries and retrieves relevant information from the knowledge graph. It also utilizes LLMs to incorporate insights from unstructured document embeddings for comprehensive answers.

By running all processes locally, NeoGPT ensures user data privacy while delivering efficient and accurate results. With its intuitive interface and robust backend, NeoGPT serves as a powerful tool for those seeking to gain insights and answer questions from their documents effectively.
